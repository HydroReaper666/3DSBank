# 3DSBank
Have you hit the 300 title limit on your 3DS, and/or want more than 300 titles, but don't want to make an EmuNAND (or 2nd one), or use another SD card?

The answer, is 3DSBank!

With this, you can store your `Nintendo 3DS` folder into a bank, and select or create another one to use, containing your other titles (or themes, or badges).
